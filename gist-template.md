# Title (replace with your title)

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain a regular expression, also known as regex. (choose your team: "rejex" or "re-gex") 

## Summary

The regex I will be describing is: 
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

This will be used to validate the input of an email.
